# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC proposes a new function attribute, `#[instruction_set(set)]` which allows you to declare the instruction set to be used when compiling the function. It also proposes two initial allowed values for the ARM arch (`arm::a32` and `arm::t32`). Other allowed values could be added to the language later.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Starting with `ARMv4T`, many ARM CPUs support two separate instruction sets. At the time they were called "ARM code" and "Thumb code", but with the development of `AArch64`, they're now called `a32` and `t32`. Unlike with the `x86_64` architecture, where the CPU can run both `x86` and `x86_64` code, but a single program still uses just one of the two instruction sets, on ARM you can have a single program that intersperses both `a32` and `t32` code. A particular form of branch instruction allows for the CPU to change between the two modes any time it branches, and so code can be designated as being either `a32` or `t32` on a per-function basis.

In LLVM, selecting that code should be `a32` or `t32` is done by either disabling (for `a32`) or enabling (for `t32`) the `thumb-mode` target feature. Previously, Rust was able to do this using the `target_feature` attribute because it was able to either add _or subtract_ an LLVM target feature during a function. However, when [RFC 2045](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2045-target-feature.md) was accepted, its final form did not allow for the subtraction of target features. Its final form is primarily designed around always opting _in_ to additional features, and it's no longer the correct tool for an "either A or B, but not both" situation like `a32`/`t32` is.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Some platforms support having more than one instruction set used within a single program. Generally, each one will be better for specific parts of a program. Every target has a default instruction set, based on the target triple. If you would like to set a specific function to use an alternate instruction set you use the `#[instruction_set(set)]` attribute.

Currently this is only of use on ARM family CPUs, which support both the `arm::a32` and `arm::t32` instruction sets. Targets starting with `arm` (eg: `arm-linux-androideabi`) default to `arm::a32` and targets starting with `thumb` (eg: `thumbv7neon-linux-androideabi`) default to `arm::t32`.

```rust
// this uses the default instruction set for your target
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

// This will compile as `a32` code on both `arm` and `thumb` targets
#[instruction_set(arm::a32)]
fn add_five(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 5
}
```

It is a compile time error to specify an instruction set that is not available on the target you're compiling for. Users wishing for their code to be as portable as possible should use `cfg_attr` to only enable the attribute when using the appropriate targets.

```rust
// This will fail to build if `arm::a32` isn't available
#[instruction_set(arm::a32)]
fn add_five(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 5
}

// This will build on all platforms, and apply the `instruction_set` attribute
// only on ARM targets.
#[cfg_attr(target_cpu="arm", instruction_set(arm::a32))]
fn add_six(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 6
}
```

As you can see it can get a little verbose, so projects which plan to use the `instruction_set` attribute might want to consider writing a proc-macro with a shorter name.

The specifics of _when_ you should specify a non-default instruction set on a function are platform specific. Unless a piece of platform documentation has indicated a specific requirement, you do not need to think about adding this attribute at all.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

Every target is now considered to have one default instruction set (for functions that lack the `instruction_set` attribute), as well as possibly supporting specific additional instruction sets:

* The targets with names that start with `arm` default to `arm::a32`, but can also use `arm::t32`.
* The targets with names that start with `thumb` default to `arm::t32`, but can also use `arm::a32`.
* The `instruction_set` attribute is not currently defined for use with any other arch.
* To avoid possible name clashes, the convention for this attribute is that the name of the instruction set itself (eg: `a32`) is prefixed with the name of the arch it goes with (eg: `arm`).

Where can this attribute be used:
* This attribute can be used on any `fn` item that has a body: Free functions, inherent methods, trait default methods, and trait impl methods.
* This attribute cannot be used on closures or within `extern` block declarations.
* (Allowing this on trait prototypes is a Future Possibility.)

What is a Compile Error:
* If an alternate instruction set is designated that doesn't exist (eg: "unicorn") then that is a compiler error. Later versions of the compiler/language are free to add additional allowed instruction set values.
* Specifying an alternate instruction set attribute more than once with each usage being for a _different arch_ it is allowed.

Guarantees:
* If an alternate instruction set is designated on a function then the compiler _must_ respect that. It is not a hint, it is a guarantee.
* The exact details of an `instruction_set` guarantee vary by target.
* Notably, the `instruction_set` attribute is most likely to interact (in a target specific way) with function inlining and use of inline assembly.

## ARM

(this portion is a little extra technical, and very platform specific)

On ARM, there are two different instruction encodings. In textual/assembly form, Thumb assembly is written as a subset of ARM assembly, but the actual bit patterns produced when the text is assembled are entirely different. The CPU has a bit within the Program Status Register that indicates if the CPU should read 4 bytes at the Program Counter address and interpret them as an `a32` opcode, or if it should read 2 bytes at the Program Counter address and interpret them as a `t32` opcode. Because the amount of data read and the interpretation of the data is totally dissimilar, attempting to read one form of code while the CPU's flag is set for the other form of code is Undefined Behavior.

The outside world can tell what type of code a given function is based on the address of the function: `a32` code has an even address, and `t32` code has an odd address. The Program Counter ignores the actual value of the low bit, so `t32` code is still considered to be "aligned to 2". When a branch-exchange (`bx`) or branch-link-exchange (`blx`) instruction is used then the target address's lowest bit is used to determine the CPU's new code state. When a branch (`b`) or branch-link (`bl`) instruction are used, the CPU's code state is _not_ changed.

Thus, what we have to ensure with `a32` and `t32` is that the code generated for the marked function has the right encoding and also that the address is correctly even or odd:

* It is _Guaranteed_ that the address of the function will be correctly even or odd, and also that the start of the function's body will be in the correct encoding.
* It is _Hinted_ for the entire function body to generate with a single encoding.
* If necessary, it is considered conforming for a compiler to insert only a stub of the correct encoding and address, which then jumps to a function body using another encoding. This should be considered a fallback strategy, but it would technically satisfy the requirements.

Backend support:
* In LLVM this corresponds to enabling or disabling the `thumb-mode` target feature on a particular function.
* Other future backends (eg: Cranelift) would presumably support this in some similar way. A "quick and dirty" version of `a32`/`t32` interworking can be achieved simply by simply placing all `a32` code in one translation unit, all `t32` code in another, and then telling the linker to sort it out. Currently, Cranelift does not support ARM chips _at all_, but they can easily work towards this over time.
* Because Miri operates on Rust's MIR stage, this attribute doesn't affect the operation of Miri. If Miri were to some day support inline assembly this attribute would need to be taken into account for that to work right, but Miri could also simply choose to not support this attribute in combination with inline assembly.
* Assemblers and Linkers for ARM platforms have flags to enable the "interwork" of `a32` and `t32` code. If a user is writing their own assembly and then linking that with Rust code manually they might have to adjust their flags appropriately. This is mostly an implementation detail, though we can do our best to document that in the reference, and to provide any "good defaults" on our end.

Inlining:
* If a function call is inlined, there's no longer an actual branch to another address, so if an entirely rust function with the `instruction_set` attribute is inlined into the caller, there's no further effect for the attribute to have.
* If a function with an `instruction_set` attribute _also_ contains an inline assembly block things are complicated. Even if the assembly text _were_ valid within the instruction set it was inlined into, checking if that's the case or not would involve inspecting the assembly string and then making decisions based on that, which is explicitly against the design intent of the inline assembly feature (that the compiler should generally not inspect the assembly string).
* Unfortunately, it's also not always clear to the programmer when inlining happens because sometimes a function might be inlined up through several layers of the call stack.
* How to resolve this is an Unresolved Question (see below).

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

## Rationale

Here's a simple but complete-enough program of how this would be used in practice. In this example, the program is for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). I have attempted to limit it to the essentials, so all the MMIO definitions, as well as the assembly runtime you'd need to boot and call `main`, are still omitted from the example.

```rust
// The GBA's BIOS provides some functionality available via software
// interrupt. We expose them to Rust in our assumed assembly "runtime".
extern "C" fn {
    /// Puts the CPU into a low-power state until a vblank interrupt,
    /// and then returns after the interrupt handler completes.
    VBlankInterWait(isize, isize);
}

// We assume that the MMIO stuff is imported from somewhere.
// The exact addresses and constant values aren't important.
mod all_the_gba_mmio_definitions;
use all_the_gba_mmio_definitions::*;

fn main() {
    // All of the `write_volatile` calls here refer to
    // the method of the `*mut T` type. Proper safe abstractions
    // for all of this would complicate the example, so we
    // simply use raw pointers and one large `unsafe` block.
    unsafe {
        // set the interrupt function to be our handler
        INTR_FN_ADDR.write_volatile(core::transmute(my_inter_fn));

        // enable vblank interrupts
        DISPSTAT.write_volatile(DISPSTAT_VBLANK);
        IME.write_volatile(IME_VBLANK);
        IE.write_volatile(true);
        
        // set the device for a basic display mode.
        DISPCNT.write_volatile(MODE3_BG2);
        let mut x = 0;
        loop {
            // wait in a low-power state for the vertical blank to start.
            VBlankInterWait(0, 0);
            // draw one new red pixel per frame along the top.
            VRAM_MODE3.row(0).col(x).write(RED);
            x += 1;
            // loop our position as necessary so that we don't
            // go out of bounds.
            if x >= VRAM_MODE3::WIDTH { x = 0 }
        }
    }
}

/// Responds to any interrupt by clearing all interrupt flags
/// and then immediately returning with no other effect.
#[instruction_set(arm::a32)]
fn my_inter_fn() {
    INTER_BIOS_FLAGS.write_volatile(ALL_INTER_FLAGS);
    INTER_STANDARD_FLAGS.write_volatile(ALL_INTER_FLAGS);
}
```

1) We setup the device with our interrupt handler.
2) We set the device to have an interrupt every time the vertical blank starts.
3) We set the display to use a basic bitmap mode and begin our loop.
4) Each pass of the loop we wait for vertical blank, then draw a single pixel to video memory.

In the case of this particular device, the hardware interrupts go to the device's BIOS, which then calls your interrupt handler function. However, because the BIOS is `a32` code and uses a `b` branch instead of a `bx` branch-exchange, it jumps to the handler with the CPU in an `a32` state. If the handler were written as `t32` code it would immediately trigger UB.

## Alternatives 

* Extending `target_feature` to allow `#[target_feature(disable = "...")]` and adding `thumb-mode` to the whitelist would support this functionality without adding another distinct attribute; however, this does not fit with the `target_feature` attribute's current focus on features such as AVX and SSE whose absence is not necessarily compensated for by the presence of something else.

* Doing nothing is an option; it is currently possible to incorporate code using other instruction sets through means such as external assembly and build scripts. However, this has greatly reduced ergonomics.

* Of note is the fact that this is a feature that mostly improves Rust's support for the more legacy end of ARM devices. Newer devices, with much larger amounts of memory (relatively), don't usually benefit as much. They could simply compile the entire program as `a32`, without needing to gain the space savings of `t32` code.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

In C you can use `__attribute__((target("arm")))` and `__attribute__((target("thumb")))` to access similar functionality. It's a compiler-specific extension, but it's supported by both GCC and Clang ([this PR](https://reviews.llvm.org/D33721) appears to be the one that added this feature to LLVM/clang).

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- How do we ensure that `instruction_set` and inline assembly always interact correctly? This isn't an implementation blocker but needs to be resolved before Stabilization of the attribute.
  * Currently, LLVM will not inline `a32` functions into `t32` functions and vice versa, because they count as different code targets. However, this is not necessarily a guarantee from LLVM, it could just be the current implementation, so more investigation is needed.

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

* If Rust gains support for the 65C816, the `#[instruction_set(?)]` attribute might be extended to allow shifting into its 65C02 compatibility mode and back again.

* MIPS has a 16-bit encoding which uses a similar scheme as ARM, where the low bit of a function's address is set when the 16-bit encoding is in use for that function.

* It might become possible to apply this attribute to trait prototypes in a future versions, in which case all impls of the method would take on the attribute. The main problems are properly specifying it and also that it would add additional compiler complexity for very minimal gain.
  * Even without this change, a particular impl of the trait can use the attribute on its methods.

* LLVM might eventually gain support for inter-instruction-set calls that allow calls between two arches (eg: a hybrid PowerPC/RISC-V).
